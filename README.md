# STRANDED: FIND YOUR WAY BACK HOME.

You were sent on a reconnaissance mission to see if humans could colonize the planet HD 011235 b. Your crew left the planet with one less person than they had when they had arrived. And getting back home will be a challenge. While the air is fully breathable, there are hostile extraterrestrials roaming the planet. It is, however, possible. Will you be able to do it? Will you survive and find your way back home? Or will you be __STRANDED__ forevermore?
